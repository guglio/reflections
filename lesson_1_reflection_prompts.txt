How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

- It was a very simple and fast way to spot the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

- You can see the all history of the file, so yoou can see the solutions to different bugs,
or different approach and techique to some issues to solve some minor or major problems

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

- I think that the manual version, is less efficient, because you need to remeber to create
the commit, but, you can just make less commits, with bigger changes.
The automatic version, is the opposite.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

- Because git consider the connection between the files, instead, other version control system like Google Docs, doesn't consider the files connections.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

- First you use "git log" to see the commits, and than, you can use "git diff commit1 commit2" to see the differences between those two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

- Because you have the possibility to break the current commit, and return to the previous one, that wasn't broke

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

- I'll probably use for my websites.
